As I was figuring out how to show filtered lists of blog posts, I came across the [HTML summary and details tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_summary.asp).  I put the title of the list in the `<summary>` tag, and the list itself in `<details>`.  When you click the `<summary>` tag, it will toggle display of whatever is in `<details>`.  Handy for simple dropdown lists without javascript.  Check it out - I hope it helps you!

There are a [bunch of html tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) that are not often used but that can be really helpful.
