    <h2 id="learn-in-public" >Learn in Public</h2>
    <p>
        This is my To-Learn list.  I was inspired to put it here for everyone to see after reading about the idea of learning in public on <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">Tania Rascia's website</a>, where she links to the original article at <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">swyx.io</a>.  Right now I'm focused building this website and some software to help me at work, so this list will focus on those two areas for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I learn something on this list, I will write a blog post about it.  The idea is write the article I wish I had found when I was learning.  This is guaranteed to help at least one person (me!), and hopefully will help others coming after me as well.

        I'm making this website with the Angular web framework and Scully.  I'm using Angular for my Routerbase software project and it makes sense to get more practice with it by using it for my website.  Scully is a Static Site Generator for Angular.  Static sites are more secure and load faster.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Add an email subscription option for new content, and start an email list.
        </li>
        <li>
            Markdown: extra formatting, and how to get that into Scully (for example, footnote support, smileys).  Accurate Markdown preview in VS Code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Layout: how to add a column for in-article navigation on the right hand side.  Like Github articles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a fast, comprehensive search bar, that starts returning results as you type, similar to <a href="https://joplinapp.org">Joplin's</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Tags: add them to posts, add capability to sort and group and organize and search by tags
        </li>
        <li>
            Make and add a custom Angular Material theme for the website
        </li>
        <li>
            Using Github with Visual Studio Code.  The Github website is the most popular place to upload and share software code.  I will use it to host the code for this website for Netlify to go get every time it gets updated.  Both Github and Visual Studio Code are owned by Microsoft and my impression is it is pretty easy to upload an entire project, I just haven't done it before.
        </li>
        <li>
            Search Engine Optimization with Angular/Scully project.  I want to make sure that Google can properly crawl and index the site.
        </li>
        <li>
            I really want to learn and understand Scully, since it is a tool I'm using a lot.  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="routerbase-project">Routerbase project</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Resizable layout windows.  If I have columns in my app for different areas of the screen, the user should be able to move their mouse to the column border and move the border to resize a given column.</li>
        <li>
            Dynamically sizing d3 graphs based on window size - from pixels to percentage</li>
        <li>
            How to organize the JSON file with the saved data so it is easily searchable and useable  </li>
        <li>
            Add a fast, comprehensive search bar, that starts returning results as you type (repeat from website)</li>
        <li>
            Tags: add them to tasks, add capability to sort and group and organize and search by tags (repeat from website)</li>
        <li>
            Electron integration with Angular.  Electron is a platform that lets you take a web app made with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and port it to the desktop as a Windows or Mac OS native program.</li>
        <li>
            Angular Modules, Components, Services, Directives, and any other major construct I missed.  Especially I'd like to learn when I should use a module vs a component.</li>
        <li>
            Drag-and-drop capability for files to be associated with a particular step or task.</li>
        <li>
            View picture files directly in the app, view other files with their icons.</li>
        <li>
            Best way to manage state for this app.  Maybe NgRx, maybe services?  The state is all the data that can change how your app is displayed and works.  So if you have a recipe book app, the current master list of recipes and ingredients as well as the current user's culinary preferences and what they just searched for would all be in the state.  Seems important to have a good handle on!</li>
        <li>
            using surge or netlify to host demo of angular stuff on github</li>
        <li>
            Testing and debugging angular projects.  That is a huge topic, but I want to learn the best and most important ways to debug my small, humble project.</li>
        <li>
            Angular: Event-Emitter vs Subject.  Both of these are ways for certain parts or functions in your software to subscribe to events, i.e. be informed when a user clicks a button or something changes in a database.  But when should I use one vs the other?</li>
        <li>
            Angular: Class vs Interface.  What exactly are they and when should I use one vs the other?</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            VS Code customization.  Things like shortcuts, using Github in VS Code, etc.  There is way more here than I am using
        </li>
        <li>
            Functional vs object oriented programming: I've heard these terms thrown around a lot and want to make sure I understand the difference between them

            Dynamic dashboards with D3 and Angular.  D3 is a visualization library I'm learning for my software, but it does a lot more than I'm using it for.  In particular people use it to show all on one page data that can change dynamically as the database gets updated, for example financial or manufacturing data in a plant, schedule estimates, quality metrics, and so forth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Docker - I've heard that Docker is a very common way to play with code in a "sandbox" on your computer, so in case something goes wrong your computer doesn't get messed up.  Sounds like a good idea!
